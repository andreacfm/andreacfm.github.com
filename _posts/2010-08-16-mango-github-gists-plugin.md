<p><img style="border: 0pt none; margin: 5px; float: left;" src="/images/posts/logo_gist.png" alt="" width="152" height="41" />Something very cool about <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">github</a> services are <a href="http://gist.github.com/" target="_blank">gists</a>.</p>
<p>Gists are a sort of snippets than you can create, share and embedd using a simple js script tag. I have started to use them very often and I think I will that more and more in the future. JUst think about that gists are also plain git repo and as any git repo can be cloned and shared between your team.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>I have created a very simple Mango plugin ( mango in very easy when you want to create plugins !!! ) so that you can embed your gists in your mango posts.</p>
<p>Syntax is incredibly easy .... just have a look <a href="http://wiki.github.com/andreacfm/mango.gists/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>The mango auto install url is : <strong>http://github.com/downloads/andreacfm/mango.gists/com.andreacfm.mango.gists_1.0.zip</strong></p>
<p>You can also download the zip or clone the source form the same GitHub repo.</p>
<p>Have fun !</p>
