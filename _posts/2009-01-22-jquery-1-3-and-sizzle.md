<p>One of the most interesting thing of the new jquery release ( <a href="http://code.google.com/p/jqueryjs/downloads/detail?name=jquery-1.3.1.js&amp;downloadBtn=" target="_blank">1.3.1 with bug fixing</a> ) is the new css selctor engine called "Sizzle".</p>
 <!--more-->

<p>The css engine has been abstracted from the jquery core code so to be usable alsoinstand alone mode. Normally this shoud not be so important news but the fact that sizzle parsing speed looks to be so impressive make it available also to others library like prototype,mootools and others.</p>
