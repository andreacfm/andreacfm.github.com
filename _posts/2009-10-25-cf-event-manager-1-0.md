<p>After more than 1 year of testing I have finally reached a stable version of a feature I use since long time.</p>
<!--more-->
 <p>A previous version released on riaforge 6 months ago has been completely rewritten and extended.</p>  ### Who Em is for??  <ul>   <li>Developers interested in developing cfml using an events based programming paradigm in the every day coding practice&#160; (not only inside an MVC like model glue or coldbox). </li>    <li>Anyone interested in making his own applications extensibles.</li>    <li>Developers looking for a base framework to build on.</li> </ul>  ### Is Em an MVC framework ??  <p>No, EM is about events. </p>  <p>Almost any application is based on events so EM can be the base of almost any cfml application or framework you want to build.</p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <ul>   <li>A dedicated site has been created&#160;&#160; <a href="http://cfeventmanager.com">http://cfeventmanager.com</a> </li>    <li>Tickets, Road Map and Docs ( actually 60% ) can be found at&#160; <a href="http://trac.cfeventmanager.com">http://trac.cfeventmanager.com</a></li> </ul>  <p>Please have a look and let me have your feedbacks.
