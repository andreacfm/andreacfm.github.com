I always use fusion debug or internal cf inline debugger when using abode cf and sometimes I felt the lack of that developing with Railo.</p>
<p>The good news is that a railo compliant version of <a href="http://www.fusion-reactor.com/" target="_blank">Fusion Debug</a> will be available very very soon ( the public beta programm has just finished some week ago ). I had the opportunity to test the beta product and was working just fine as I expected it. </p>

<p>The functionalities are great and basically the same of the Fusion Debug version for coldfusion. Installation gave me some trouble that I easily solved on the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/fusiondebug3beta" target="_blank">google groups</a> that the guys of Integral setted up to support .  </p>
<p>As far as I know the<a href="http://www.getrailo.com/index.cfm/products/railo-bundles/railo-enterprise-bundle/" target="_blank"> enterprise Railo</a> edition will include a license of both Reactor and Debug products. I am a Fusion Debug license owner but I am not sure if the Railo product will need a license update or not. I am waiting the product release in the next weeks to check it. </p>
<p>In conclusion I think that having an inline debugger available make Railo even more a robust solution.</p>
