<p>At the and arrived the day of the release of Railo 3.1. This is a milestone due to the fact that from this date Railo is officialy Open Source and most important joins a wide supportedÂ  project like Jboss.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Many news that I think will make the fortune of Railo that I am starting to consider any day more like my choice for the future:</p>

<ul>
<li>Brand new sites taht will be soon filled with news and docs ( <a href="http://www.getrailo.com" target="_blank">getRailo.com</a> and <a href="http://www.getrailo.org" target="_blank">getRailo.org</a> )</li>
<li>Beta 3.1 version on Resin</li>
<li>First experiment ( this is whant I am mostly interested in ) of jboss/railo installer on IIS7</li>
<li>Railo will now have an extension manager connected to the website repository. There will be an api to give any developer the road to follow to write your own extensions and the place where to share them......I think this will be the key.</li>
</ul>
<p>Good luck to railo and to the railo team!</p>
