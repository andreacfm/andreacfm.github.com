web application data far more efficiently and cost effectively than it
can be stored in a relational database. With NorthScale Membase Server,
<!--more-->
organizations can deploy a highly available, cloud-friendly data layer
that expands dynamically as application needs change, delivering
performance exceeding that of any other NoSQL solution. API compatible
with memcached, the de facto standard web caching software, Membase is
easy to use and supported by virtually every programming language and
application framework.</em></p>
<p><a href="http://www.northscale.com/products/membase_server.html" target="_blank">Membase</a> gives you an easy way to access and use <a href="http://memcached.org/" target="_blank">memcached </a>as a key-value database. Membase is a very powerfull solution if you need a reliable, fast and distribuited cache engine. </p>
