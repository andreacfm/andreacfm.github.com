<p>At the moment there is no official post by the team but my Railo has updated to version 3.1.1 right now so I guess .... here we are.</p>
<p>Over the usual bug fixing ( Railo users are used to get bug fixing very fast ....... think about that.....)Â  this release is important cause is the first stable release after that Railo choosed the OS way. Since some month now I am using Railo as my only cfml engine and I take this occasion to say thanks to Gert, Micheal and all the team for the good work! </p>
