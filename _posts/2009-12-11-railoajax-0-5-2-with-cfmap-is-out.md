<p><a href="http://projects.getrailo.org/projects/railoajax/" target="_self">Railo Ajax</a> arrived to version 0.5.2.</p>
<p>From this release <strong>cfmap</strong> has entered into the set of tags that RailoAjax ships. Cfmap support is still experimental and do not cover event the 50% of the ACF version but development is on the way. </p>
<!--more-->
<p>See more <a href="http://projects.getrailo.org/projects/railoajax/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>Remember that the demo app that you see online is installed ( if required ) when RailoAjax deploy on your Railo server. So you can have a look to the demo code that can help you on development stage.</p>
<p>Another important announcment is that CFMENU is on the way to appear from a community contribution. Cfmenu has been added to 0.6 milestone ( at least in alpha version ).</p>
<p>Next step will be focused on docs. For a month or so the main efforts ( over cfmap implementation ) will be on dodumenting what has been done up to know keeping an eye on bugs of course.</p>
<p>Do not hesistate to contact me for any question and of course .... project is open ... so feel free to jump in ....</p>
