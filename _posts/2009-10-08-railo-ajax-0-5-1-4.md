<p>This version of <a href="http://railoajax.org" target="_blank">RailoAjax</a> starts the support of functions not strictly related to a tag or to a UI object like tabs or windows. </p>
<!--more-->
<p>Firsts functions to be supported are:</p>
<p><strong>Railo.Ajax.submitForm<br />(formId,url,callbackhandler[,errorhandler,httpMethod,asynch,returnFormat,beforeSend])</strong></p>
<p>You can use this fucntions to ask a form to be ajax submitted at any time with no need to trigger the submit event.</p>
<p><strong>Railo.Ajax.ajaxForm<br />(formId[,target,callbackhandler,errorhandler,returnFormat,beforeSend])</strong></p>
<p>This function is used to configure a form to be submitted in ajax mode. The main difference with the previous one is that in this case the form will be submitted in ajax mode in any case, and not only when invoked by the function itself.</p>
<p>Railo.Ajax.navigate is on development stage.</p>
