If you use the <a href="http://trac.getrailo.org/installers/" target="_blank">Railo Installers</a> ( thanks again Jordan for this !! ) anything should already being setted up and ready to use but in case of any needs there was a lack of public informations about this topic.</p>

<p>We have now a nice <a href="http://wiki.getrailo.org/wiki/Amf:configuration" target="_blank">wiki section</a> where you can find a very exhaustive explanations of many aspect of this topic ( credits to <a href="http://www.getrailo.com/index.cfm/about-us/railo-team/roland-ringgenberg/" target="_blank">Roland Ringgenberg</a> ) .</p>
<p>Have a nice Railo/Blaze Ds integration !!</p>
