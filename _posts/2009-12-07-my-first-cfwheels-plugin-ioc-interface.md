<p><img style="float: left; margin: 10px;" src="/images/posts/cfwheels-logo.png" alt="" width="93" height="121" />I decided to play around with <a href="http://cfwheels.org" target="_blank">cfwheels</a> cause I was amazed by some examples I saw around and I have to admit is good fun. </p>

<p>After 1 hr testing I realized that no ioc support is build into cfwheels and ..... I really cannot live with no Ioc container available at any time so I decided to add a plugin for managing a beanFactory into cfwheels.</p>
<p>Probably is not the best cfwheel plugin ever written but was very easy and painless. While I tend to be very OO guy I am amazed by conventions in last period ( I am also playing with Sean Corfield <a href="http://fw1.riaforge.org/" target="_blank">FW1</a> ). While I am also an happy user of Coldbox and ModelGlue I find that sometimes frameworks added complexity also to easy tasks. From here my desire to look into frameworks that make of conventions their core basement.</p>
<p>In my mind conventions means less code in default situations and about this cfwheels and fw1 at the moment are the best. Btw I also think that for a more complex task Coldbox really has something more to help development of more advanced applications.</p>
<p>You can find the plugin <a href="http://cfwheels.org/plugins/listing/22" target="_blank">here</a> to play with it and have a look to <a href="http://cfwheels.org" target="_blank">cfwheels</a>.</p>
