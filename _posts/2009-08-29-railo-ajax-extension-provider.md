<p>I have created a Railo extension provider from my website. For the moment the only application you can install is the Railo Ajax Project that is also available from the <strong><em>http://preview.getrailo.org/ExtensionProvider.cfc</em></strong> provider. </p>
<!--more-->
<p>So now you have more choice... and I had the occasion to go deeper into railo extensions programming...</p>
<p>Just add this url in the providers list of your Railo Admin ( server or web ) :</p>
<p><em><strong>http://www.andreacfm.com/railoEx/andreacfm.cfc</strong></em></p>
<p>Verify the provider and then you will find the Railo Ajax application available in the applications list. Run the install thread that will also install some demo into yoru webroot.</p>
<p>IMPORTANT:</p>
<p><em>If you have already installed the extension from the </em>http://preview.getrailo.org/ExtensionProvider.cfc <em>provider stay with that. I will update both the providers with new versions at the same time but as the providers are different and the extension have the same id some conflict is possible. Just choose one provider.</em></p>
