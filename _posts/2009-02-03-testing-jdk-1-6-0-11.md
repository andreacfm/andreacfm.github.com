<p>I have made a fast speed test to see how much the new jdk has increased my cf8 speed.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The test was very easy and consisting on the looping 1000 times around a createObject statement and run a simple init method on each like following:</p>

{% highlight html %}

<cfloop from="1" to="1000" index="i">
    <cfset createObject('component','testobject').init() />
</cfloop>

{% endhighlight %}

<p><strong>Here the results</strong></p>
<p> <em><strong class="message">JDK 1.6.0_7 ( as my previous built on cf8 )</strong></em></p>
<p>ColdFusion : 2.4 secs average</p>
<p>Railo : 1.1 secs average</p>
<p> <span class="message">JDK 1.6.0_11</span></p>
<p>ColdFusion : 1.2 secs average</p>
<p>Railo : 0.7 secs average</p>
<p>I was really surprised to discover that my cf8 increased the craeteObject speed of 50% and I have honestly to say that also the <a href="http://www.railo-technologies.com/en/index.cfm" target="_blank">railo</a> speed really impressed me</p>
