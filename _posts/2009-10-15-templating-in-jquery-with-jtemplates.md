<p>I am working in these days on the front side of an application that need to manage a huge amount of data pushed in JSON format. </p>
<!--more-->
<p>These datas are not needed to be analyzed or filtered. </p>  <p>What I&#160; need is to be able to display info ( coming in a unique set of data )&#160; in many different part of the page using quite complex html generated by many conditional statements. Of course I need to be able to refresh the different areas individually. </p>  <p>I have used in the past spry or ext in these case but I always considered both oversized for this job, at the end the dataset has not to be manipulated. </p>  <p>I have then found a very powerfull solutions in <a href="http://jtemplates.tpython.com/" target="_blank">jTemplates</a>. This is a wonderfull templating tool that can be used as jquery plugin or in plain js. Between the features available :</p>  <ul>   <li>conditional statements</li>    <li>looping</li>    <li>parameters</li>    <li>nested templates</li> </ul>  <p>Performance are very good. Have a try I really recommend this. </p>
