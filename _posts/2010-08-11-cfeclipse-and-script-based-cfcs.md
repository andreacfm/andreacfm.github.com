While the <a href="http://www.cfeclipse.org/" target="_blank">cfeclipse</a> team is working on giving support to the new scripting syntax added recently in cfml I falled into something that can help someone to have a better feeeling in the meantime.
<!--more-->
I was not aware, until yesterday, that this syntax is supported in a script based cfc:
{% gist 1035566 %}
So while it does not really looks "amazing" this will give you code colouring and syntax highlighting. But, most important, the syntax is fully supported from ACF and Railo too ( did not test on OpenBD ).

Some of you will be asking why to do that ? Just use cfbuilder .... and I agree. Cfbuilder is a great tool also if , in my opinion , lack of linux support. But I am one of those who are convinced that cfml deserves an open and strong ide to attract more developers so ... if you think like me consider to donate something to <a href="http://www.cfeclipse.org/" target="_blank">cfeclipse project</a>.
