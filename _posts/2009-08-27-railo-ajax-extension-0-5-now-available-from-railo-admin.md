<p>Some moths ago I started to work on a project to create Railo support for ajax tags. The idea was to implement CfAjaxProxy using the new custom tag based on cfc format that Railo makes available.</p>
<p>We decided to use <a href="http://jquery.com/" target="_blank">jQuery</a> <a href="http://www.jquery.com/" target="_blank"></a>as library to work on. I have a good feeling with it and we kept the door opened also for UI tags implementation. Things went quite well and I am particulary happy of the Bind system that manage cfc/url and javascript bindings.</p>
<p>I have also added support for <strong>cfdiv</strong> and for testing purposes also of <strong>cfwindow</strong> and cfajaximport ( this is really more as internal use for now ). Installing the Railo Ajax Extension you will also have the option to install a demo page that I will make more explicative in the next days. New examples, comments and notes are on the way.</p>
<p>You can find install isntructions <a href="http://www.railo.ch/blog/index.cfm/2009/8/27/Railo--AJAX-Tags" target="_blank">here</a> while project is actually hosted <a href="http://www.assembla.com/wiki/show/ayq2o8uq0r3PTOeJe5aVNr" target="_blank">here</a>. Please use assembla site for tickects and any other support needs. You can also post on the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/railo-beta" target="_self">railobeta</a> Google Group.</p>
<p>A special thanks to the Gert that hepled me a lot in writing the Railo Extension ( a post/tutorial is on the way ).</p>
