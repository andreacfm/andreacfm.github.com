<p>I am a bit late blogging about this but I had a quite 'intense' maech. </p>
<!--more-->
<p>Since version 3.1.2.009 <a href="http://getrailo.org" target="_blank">Railo</a> starts the ajax tags support . You can read more <a href="http://www.railo.ch/blog/index.cfm/2010/3/24/Railo-Ajax-changes-in-312009" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>Ok so what's teh big news? What make me proud is that I developed those tags and after a long debugging they are finally part of the Railo core engine. The tags comes from the RailoAjax project that will go on focusing on the remaining ajax tags to fill the gap with ACF ( that's the plan .... but it's a long road to do ....).</p>
<p>This is an example of how a community effort can really contribute to the main project. I am sure more efforts will come in the future ... so if you an idea .... some spare time ..... and you wish to contribute do not hesitate to contact me .... Railo needs you.</p>
