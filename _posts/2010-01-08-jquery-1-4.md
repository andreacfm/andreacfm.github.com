<p><img style="border:0; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; float: left;" src="/images/posts/jquery.gif" alt="" width="132" height="132" />I am quite interested in what is happening in jQuery for the next 2 weeks. </p>
<p>With the release of version 1.4 the jQ team has announced 14 days of news, code relaeases etc.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The <a href="http://jquery14.com" target="_blank">website</a> created for the event is nice and as pre release day news we got a brand new <a href="http://jquery14.com/pre-release-1/new-jquery-api-site" target="_blank">api browser site</a> that looks most efficient and organized.</p>
<p>So let's wait and see what news will come in teh next weeks.</p>
