A couple of weeks ago I was reading a post from Raymond Camden that remembered me I completely forgot to add support to addevent() in Railo cfmap implementation. The blog post was quite interesting and showed a way to add streetview to a google map, generated by cfmap, using the Coldfusion.Map.addEvent function. Read the post <a href="http://www.coldfusionjedi.com/index.cfm/2011/2/11/Adding-Google-Streetview-to-ColdFusion-CFMAP" target="_blank">here</a>.

Of course code was not running in Railo due to the lack of the method in the Railo js library.

I made a patch and support was added in Railo 3.2.1.005/3.3.0.005.

So following the Ray example (all credits to Ray for the following code) you can run the following code in Railo and adding a streeview to your cfmap using the addEvent() function.

Please note that in Railo js library are available both the <strong>Railo</strong> and <strong>Coldfusion</strong> namespaces so <strong>Railo.Map.addEvent()</strong> is equivalent as running <strong>Coldfusion.Map.addEvent()</strong>.

Have fun!
